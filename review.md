Not bad! I like the simplicity of your split and ttester functions.
One potential improvement is that in your ttester function you define a variable named ttester, which is the
same as the function name, this should be avoided in case you want to recursively call the function.
Nice job on the docstrings. It's good practice to include an @param for the arguments and @returns.
You did give a nice description of what the functions do which is good.
